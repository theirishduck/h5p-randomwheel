H5P Random Wheel
=========================

H5P.RandomWheel or Wheel of Fortune is a resource to engage students in your classroom.
As an author you define vocabulary, terms, dates or verb forms and leave the selection to the wheel of fortune. Depends on Winwheel.js to easily create spinning Prize Wheels on HTML5 canvas.
